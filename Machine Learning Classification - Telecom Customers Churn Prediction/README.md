In this project, we will train several classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest Classifier to predict the churn rate of Telecommunication Customers. Machine learning help companies analyze customer churn rate based on several factors such as services subscribed by customers, tenure rate, and payment method. Predicting churn rate is crucial for these companies because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.
