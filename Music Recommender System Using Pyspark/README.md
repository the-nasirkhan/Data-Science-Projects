Nowadays, recommender systems are everywhere. for example, Amazon uses recommender systems to suggest some products that you might be interested in based on the products you've bought earlier. Or Spotify will suggest new tracks based on the songs you use to listen to every day. Most of these recommender systems use some algorithms which are based on Matrix factorization such as NMF( NON NEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION) or ALS (Alternating Least Square).

In this Project, ann ALS Algorithm used to create a Music Recommender system to suggest new tracks to different users based upon the songs they've been listening to.
