<h1 align="left">Natural Language Processing for Stocks News Analysis</h1>


In this project, we will train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to perform stocks sentiment analysis. Natural language processing (NLP) works by converting words (text) into numbers, these numbers are then used to train an AI/ML model to make predictions. In this project, we will build a machine learning model to analyze thousands of Twitter tweets to predict peopleâ€™s sentiment towards a particular company or stock. The algorithm could be used automatically understand the sentiment from public tweets, which could be used as a factor while making buy/sell decision of securities.
